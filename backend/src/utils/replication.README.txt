Simple Replication for Voting System
====================================

How it works:
- When a vote is cast, if the node is the leader, it publishes the vote event to the Redis channel `votes:replicate`.
- All nodes (including the leader) subscribe to this channel at startup.
- When a vote event is received, it is logged (and can be further processed for real replication).

Key files:
- `utils/replication.js`: Handles Redis pub/sub for vote replication.
- `controllers/voteController.js`: Publishes vote events after storing a vote.
- `index.js`: Initializes replication on server startup.

Test plan:
1. Start the Swarm with all backend nodes.
2. Cast a vote via the leader node (check `/api/status` for leader).
3. Observe logs on all nodes: all should log the replicated vote event.
4. Kill the leader, wait for a new leader, cast another vote, and repeat.

You can extend the handler in `replication.js` to perform real DB replication or consistency checks as needed.
