ðŸ’¡ Project Goals:
Allow users to register and log in via email and password.

Email-based OTP is used to verify identities (not phone-based).

Authenticated users can view and vote in elections.

All vote data is end-to-end encrypted and digitally signed with RSA.

Election creation and result viewing are protected by JWT-based access control.

The entire backend is containerized and deployable via Docker Swarm.

ðŸ§± Architecture Overview:
Backend: Node.js + Express

ORM: Sequelize (Postgres as DB)

Caching + OTP store: Redis

Auth: JWT

Email OTP: SendGrid (mockable)

Security:

RSA encryption of vote payloads (rsa.js)

Digital signatures (signer.js)

sigVerifier.js middleware ensures votes are signed

JWT protects private routes

OTP limiter via express-rate-limit

Docker Swarm used for deployment orchestration

Backend, Redis, Postgres are deployed as services

RSA keys mounted via Docker secrets

âœ… Already Done:
Route structure scaffolded (auth.js, elections.js, vote.js)

Controllers stubbed

Middleware scaffolded:

jwtAuth.js, otpLimiter.js, sigVerifier.js

Utility modules scaffolded:

rsa.js, signer.js, otp.js, db.js

Models:

User: email, passwordHash

Election: title, time bounds, visibility

Vote: candidate, encryptedPayload, signature; with User and Election relations

Docker Swarm config (swarm-stack.yml)

.env file set up to use secrets and service hostnames

secrets/ contains private.pem, public.pem

ðŸš€ Your Tasks:
Implement controller logic in authController.js, electionController.js, and voteController.js.

Complete Sequelize models and associations (User â†’ Vote, Election â†’ Vote).

Implement OTP logic in otp.js using Redis.

Apply middleware correctly:

jwtAuth.js â†’ /api/elections/*, /api/vote/*

otpLimiter.js â†’ /api/auth/request-otp

sigVerifier.js â†’ POST /api/vote/cast

Ensure modular structure:

Keep each controller, middleware, and util in its file.

Don't rewrite routing or Docker setup.

Add simple test functions or console-style debug tests that exercise:

Auth flow (register â†’ login â†’ OTP)

Election creation and retrieval

Vote casting (with encryption + signature)

Signature and JWT failure paths

Add console logging at each major logic branch:

Function entry, key variable values, decision points

Catch blocks and response statuses

IMPORTANT: We have not set up the PostgreSQL DB yet.

Please guide us through:

Creating the database schema

Running Sequelize migrations (or syncing on boot for dev)

Ensuring Redis and Postgres connect correctly via Docker Swarm service names

ðŸ”— Frontend Integration:
All routes are mounted with /api prefix

CORS is enabled for all origins

Frontend only needs to change base URL to /api

Scope Notes:
This is a demo â€” donâ€™t add production-grade error handling

No need for test frameworks like Jest; inline test/debug calls are fine

Focus on getting the full happy path working first
