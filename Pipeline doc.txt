Test integration with mock backend services

4.3 Real-time Updates
Implement WebSocket server for election results broadcasting
Create filtered data streams for different client requirements
Develop real-time tallying with accurate counting
Design efficient update patterns with minimal overhead

5. Testing & Documentation (Week 5)
5.1 Comprehensive Testing

Design cluster failure simulation tests
Implement load testing for vote processing capacity
Develop integration tests with backend components

5.2 Documentation & Demo
Document Redis Cluster architecture and setup procedures
Create detailed operation guides for the distributed system
Prepare visual demonstrations of system resilience
Develop dashboard for system monitoring during presentations

Integration Points:
1. PostgreSQL Integration
- Read-only access to user/voter data for validation
- Export finalized vote tallies for persistent storage
- Keep user management separate from vote processing

2. Backend Integration (Shahliza)
- Well-defined API contracts for vote submission
- Clear error responses and validation results
- Structured vote tallies for database storage
- Authentication verification hooks

3. Frontend Integration (Areesha)
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
- Status notifications for user feedback
- Aggregated results for dashboard display
- System health metrics for admin interfaces

Key Adjustments:
- Focus on incremental implementation with working components at each stage
- Prioritize Redis Cluster setup as the foundation for truly distributed processing
- Design for separation of concerns with PostgreSQL handling user data
- Emphasize horizontal scalability and fault tolerance in all components
