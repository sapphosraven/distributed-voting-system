**Legend:**
✅ = Complete  ⚠️ = Partially/Assumed  ❌ = Not done  ❌ Skipped = Not required for demo

**Change Log:**
- [2025-05-12] Improved leader election logging: now only logs when the leader actually changes, reducing log spam and making logs easier to follow during failover and normal operation.
- [2025-05-12] Distributed system logic (leader election, failover, replication) fully implemented and tested. Voting only accepted by leader, replication confirmed, failover tested.
- [2025-05-12] All core backend flows (auth, OTP, election, voting, results) tested and confirmed.
- [2025-05-11] Steps 1, 2, 6, 7 updated to reflect working eligibility, OTP, and rate limiting.
- [2025-05-11] Per-account OTP rate limiting tested and confirmed.
- [2025-05-11 30min later] Voting logic fully tested: eligible voter can vote, double voting prevented, ineligible voter blocked.
- [2025-05-11] Distributed system logic is now MANDATORY for completion.

# Distributed System Test Checklist (2025-05-12)
- [x] Leader election: Only one leader at a time, visible via /api/status
- [x] Voting only accepted by leader node; followers reject with 503 and leader info
- [x] Replication: All nodes log [REPLICATION] messages for each vote
- [x] Failover: When leader is stopped, a new leader is elected and voting continues
- [x] No rogue/random node IDs in cluster (all nodes have NODE_ID)
- [x] Leader election logs only on leader change (log spam fixed)

---

# Next Increment
- Backend-frontend integration (API, CORS, UI)

# Deferred (for later, not required for demo)
- Implement digital signatures and end-to-end encryption for votes (sign/verify on client and backend)
- Enhance consensus: stricter Raft (terms, voting, fencing) for leader election
- Improve frontend integration and UX for distributed status/errors

# Suggestion
Focus next on backend-frontend integration. Digital signatures/E2EE and other enhancements can be done after the demo as needed.

# TODOs (as of 2025-05-12)

- [ ] Prevent election creation with a start time in the past (validate startTime >= now)
- [ ] (Optional) Decide/fix: Should empty allowedDomains/allowedEmails mean 'open to all'? (Currently not working as intended)
- [ ] Implement digital signatures and end-to-end encryption (E2EE) after distributed part is complete

# Distributed System Team Guidance
- You can proceed with distributed system logic (consensus, leader election, mutex/lock, atomic voting) **without** these TODOs being fixed.
- These are backend validation/eligibility issues and do not block distributed system implementation.
- **You do NOT need Insomnia, Postman, curl, or any external tool to test the distributed system.**
- You can use inline test hooks, console logs, or simple scripts for validation.
- The distributed part can be developed and tested independently of these validation fixes.
- **Clock/time synchronization must be implemented as part of the distributed system to ensure correct election timing and result visibility.**

# Achievements (as of 2025-05-12)

- Password change with OTP: **working**
- OTP enforcement after login: **working**
- Time-based result display: **working**
- Voting, double-voting prevention, eligibility (except 'open to all' edge case): **working**
- Results visibility logic (live/ended, voted/not): **working**
- Search, election creation, and listing: **working**
- All major flows tested with multiple users

# TIP FOR TESTING
- When creating a test election for consensus/result testing, always set:
  "isResultsVisible": true
  in your JSON body. This allows you to view results before the election ends and test consensus tallying easily.

# See below for previous progress log...

Focus next: results logic, password change, search, middleware finalization, **distributed system logic (mandatory)**.

# Project Steps & Status

## Distributed System Phase (COMPLETE)
- [x] Docker Swarm with 4 backend nodes, Redis, Postgres
- [x] Leader election (Raft, Redis TTL key)
- [x] Distributed lock for voting (Redis)
- [x] Redis server time for all time-sensitive ops
- [x] Vote replication via Redis pub/sub
- [x] Consensus-based vote tallying (majority agreement, Redis pub/sub)
- [x] Consensus logs: leader publishes request, all nodes respond, leader aggregates
- [x] Verified: All nodes participate in consensus, correct logs seen, API returns all consensus nodes
- [x] Test: Short election, all nodes respond, logs confirm distributed agreement

**Distributed system phase is complete and fully tested.**

## Next Steps
- [ ] Backend-frontend integration (connect API to frontend, test end-to-end)
- [ ] Security enhancements (digital signatures, E2EE, stricter Raft, etc.)
- [ ] UX improvements (deferred)

## Notes
- Consensus is only triggered after election end time (for security/fairness)
- Logs to look for:
  - `[CONSENSUS] Leader published tally request ...`
  - `[CONSENSUS] Node ... received tally request ...`
  - `[CONSENSUS] Node ... published tally response ...`
  - `[CONSENSUS] Leader received tally response from node ...`
- API response includes all consensus nodes
