**Legend:**
✅ = Complete  ⚠️ = Partially/Assumed  ❌ = Not done

**Change Log:**
- [2025-05-11] Steps 1, 2, 6, 7 updated to reflect working eligibility, OTP, and rate limiting.
- [2025-05-11] Per-account OTP rate limiting tested and confirmed.
- [2025-05-11 30min later] Voting logic fully tested: eligible voter can vote, double voting prevented, ineligible voter blocked.
- [2025-05-11] Distributed system logic is now MANDATORY for completion.

# TODOs (as of 2025-05-12)

- [ ] Prevent election creation with a start time in the past (validate startTime >= now)
- [ ] (Optional) Decide/fix: Should empty allowedDomains/allowedEmails mean 'open to all'? (Currently not working as intended)
- [ ] Implement digital signatures and end-to-end encryption (E2EE) after distributed part is complete
- [ ] Add clock/time synchronization across distributed nodes (for election timing, result visibility, etc.)

# Distributed System Team Guidance
- You can proceed with distributed system logic (consensus, leader election, mutex/lock, atomic voting) **without** these TODOs being fixed.
- These are backend validation/eligibility issues and do not block distributed system implementation.
- **You do NOT need Insomnia, Postman, curl, or any external tool to test the distributed system.**
- You can use inline test hooks, dummy endpoints, console logs, or simple scripts for validation.
- The distributed part can be developed and tested independently of these validation fixes.
- **Clock/time synchronization must be implemented as part of the distributed system to ensure correct election timing and result visibility.**

# Achievements (as of 2025-05-12)

- Password change with OTP: **working**
- OTP enforcement after login: **working**
- Time-based result display: **working**
- Voting, double-voting prevention, eligibility (except 'open to all' edge case): **working**
- Results visibility logic (live/ended, voted/not): **working**
- Search, election creation, and listing: **working**
- All major flows tested with multiple users

# See below for previous progress log...

Focus next: results logic, password change, search, middleware finalization, **distributed system logic (mandatory)**, then persistent volumes.
