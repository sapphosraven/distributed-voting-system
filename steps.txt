| 14. Test the Full Happy Path                              | ⚠️ Partial  | Auth, OTP, election create/list, eligibility, voting tested; results not yet           |
| 15. Console-Style Debug Tests                             | ❌ Not done | Not implemented                                                                       |

**Legend:**
✅ = Complete  ⚠️ = Partially/Assumed  ❌ = Not done

**Change Log:**
- [2025-05-11] Steps 1, 2, 6, 7 updated to reflect working eligibility, OTP, and rate limiting.
- [2025-05-11] Per-account OTP rate limiting tested and confirmed.
- [2025-05-11 30min later] Voting logic fully tested: eligible voter can vote, double voting prevented, ineligible voter blocked.
- [2025-05-11] Distributed system logic is now MANDATORY for completion.

Focus next: results logic, password change, search, middleware finalization, **distributed system logic (mandatory)**, then persistent volumes.
