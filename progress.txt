DISTRIBUTED VOTING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS
=======================================================================
Last Updated: May 14, 2024

------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTED & WORKING COMPONENTS
------------------------------------------

1. Node Server Framework
   - FastAPI server with middleware and request logging
   - Environment-based configuration and node identification

2. Redis Cluster Integration
   - Connected to Redis Cluster with proper node detection
   - Slot-aware key operations for distributed data
   - Cross-cluster pub/sub messaging
   - Health monitoring and dashboard

3. Node Management
   - Leader-follower pattern with role-specific tasks
   - Heartbeat system with failure detection
   - Dynamic node discovery and connection tracking
   - Graceful startup/shutdown with Redis registration

4. Time Synchronization
   - Leader broadcasts system time to followers
   - Consistent timestamps across the distributed system

5. Testing Infrastructure
   - Redis Cluster connection validation
   - Vote submission and consensus testing script
   - Initialization and health check scripts

6. Vote Processing (Partially Complete)
   - Basic vote data model with validation
   - API endpoints for vote submission, status, and results
   - Framework for tracking pending and finalized votes
   - Consensus protocol for vote validation and finalization
   - Test script for simulating vote submission and consensus
   - âš  **Remaining**: Digital signature verification, encryption/decryption of votes.

------------------------------------------
NEXT IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS
------------------------------------------

1. Implement leader election mechanism
2. Add vote storage and retrieval across Redis Cluster
3. Design and implement WebSocket server for real-time updates
4. Add fault tolerance mechanisms for node recovery
5. Enhance security with encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.

------------------------------------------
NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------------

- Redis Cluster provides true distribution of data across multiple nodes.
- Hash slot awareness ensures even distribution of keys.
- Current system handles node registration and heartbeats reliably.
- Consensus protocol ensures majority agreement for vote finalization.
- Security features like encryption and digital signatures are placeholders and need full implementation.
