DISTRIBUTED VOTING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS
=======================================================================
Last Updated: May 6, 2025

------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTED & WORKING COMPONENTS
------------------------------------------

1. Node Server Framework
   - FastAPI server with middleware and request logging
   - Environment-based configuration and node identification

2. Redis Cluster Integration
   - Connected to Redis Cluster with proper node detection
   - Slot-aware key operations for distributed data
   - Cross-cluster pub/sub messaging
   - Health monitoring and dashboard

3. Node Management
   - Leader-follower pattern with role-specific tasks
   - Heartbeat system with failure detection
   - Dynamic node discovery and connection tracking
   - Graceful startup/shutdown with Redis registration

4. Time Synchronization
   - Leader broadcasts system time to followers
   - Robust drift detection with median-based smoothing
   - Multi-tier drift correction strategies based on severity
   - Auto-recovery from extreme clock drift situations
   - Health monitoring with sync status reporting
   - Consistent timestamps across the distributed system
   - Reliable initial synchronization mechanism

5. Leader Election
   - Raft-inspired leader election protocol
   - Term-based elections with majority voting
   - Automatic failover when leader becomes unavailable
   - Leader heartbeat system for active monitoring
   - Proper state transitions (follower → candidate → leader)
   - Role synchronization based on election results

6. Vote Processing
   - Basic vote data model with validation
   - API endpoints for vote submission, status, and results
   - Framework for tracking pending and finalized votes
   - Consensus protocol for vote validation and finalization
   - Test script for simulating vote submission and consensus
   - Vote election reset capabilities for testing
   - ✅ Successfully integrated with API Gateway and authentication
   - ✅ End-to-end vote submission, consensus, and finalization working
   - ⚠ **Remaining**: Digital signature verification, encryption/decryption of votes

7. Distributed Mutex (NEW)
   - Redis-based distributed lock implementation
   - Atomic lock acquisition and release
   - Lua scripting for lock safety guarantees
   - Timeout mechanism for deadlock prevention
   - Context manager support for clean resource handling
   - Integration with vote processing pipeline
   - Verified operation through testing framework

8. API Gateway Integration (NEW)
   - Authentication with JWT tokens
   - User validation and role verification
   - Vote forwarding to distributed voting nodes
   - Automatic failover to alternate nodes on failure
   - Proper error handling and reporting
   - Successful end-to-end testing with distributed consensus

9. WebSocket Implementation (NEW)
   - Real-time event broadcasting infrastructure
   - Client connection management with topic subscriptions
   - Vote event formatting and distribution
   - Direct event broadcasting from API Gateway
   - HTML test client for WebSocket verification
   - Successful testing with live vote submission

10. Testing Infrastructure
   - Redis Cluster connection validation
   - Vote submission and consensus testing script
   - Initialization and health check scripts
   - Clock synchronization debugging tools
   - Mutex functionality verification
   - Authentication and API gateway integration tests
   - Network debugging and diagnostics tools
   - WebSocket connection and event testing

NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------------

- Redis Cluster provides true distribution of data across multiple nodes.
- Hash slot awareness ensures even distribution of keys.
- Current system handles node registration and heartbeats reliably.
- Consensus protocol ensures majority agreement for vote finalization.
- Leader election provides automatic recovery when the primary node fails.
- Clock synchronization works effectively with dynamic rate adjustment.
- The system remains stable even with multiple nodes and high vote throughput.
- Distributed mutex prevents race conditions in vote processing and finalization.
- API Gateway integration successfully bridges authentication and voting subsystems.
- End-to-end processing confirms successful consensus mechanism operation.
- Network connectivity is stable across the containerized environment.
- WebSocket broadcasting provides real-time vote event updates to clients.
