DISTRIBUTED VOTING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS
=======================================================================
Last Updated: April 27, 2025

------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTED & WORKING COMPONENTS
------------------------------------------

1. Node Server Framework
   - FastAPI server with middleware and request logging
   - Environment-based configuration and node identification

2. Redis Cluster Integration
   - Connected to Redis Cluster with proper node detection
   - Slot-aware key operations for distributed data
   - Cross-cluster pub/sub messaging
   - Health monitoring and dashboard

3. Node Management
   - Leader-follower pattern with role-specific tasks
   - Heartbeat system with failure detection
   - Dynamic node discovery and connection tracking
   - Graceful startup/shutdown with Redis registration

4. Time Synchronization
   - Leader broadcasts system time to followers
   - Consistent timestamps across the distributed system

5. Testing Infrastructure
   - Redis Cluster connection validation
   - Initialization and health check scripts

------------------------------------------
NEXT IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS
------------------------------------------

1. Vote processing API endpoints
2. Consensus protocol for vote validation
3. Leader election implementation
4. Vote storage and retrieval mechanisms

------------------------------------------
NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------------

- Redis Cluster provides true distribution of data across multiple nodes
- Hash slot awareness ensures even distribution of keys
- Current system handles node registration and heartbeats reliably
- Testing tools simplify cluster validation and troubleshooting
