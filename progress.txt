DISTRIBUTED VOTING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS
=======================================================================
Last Updated: April 27, 2025

------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTED & WORKING COMPONENTS
------------------------------------------

1. Node Server Basic Framework
   - Successfully implemented the node server using FastAPI
   - Node identification and configuration via environment variables
   - Basic routing and endpoint structure established
   - Middleware for request logging with unique request IDs

2. Logging System
   - Implemented multi-level logging (node, API, heartbeat, consensus)
   - Log directory configuration
   - Contextual logging with node identification
   - Request tracing with UUID generation

3. Redis Integration
   - Basic Redis connection established
   - Error handling for Redis connection failures
   - Key-value operations for node registration
   - Publish/subscribe pattern implementation for messaging

4. Node State Management
   - NodeState class tracking current node status
   - Role-based initialization (leader vs. follower)
   - Health status tracking
   - Connected nodes tracking

5. Health Monitoring
   - /health endpoint returning detailed node status
   - Redis connection health checking
   - Node status reporting
   - Uptime and performance metrics

6. Node Lifecycle Management
   - Startup registration in Redis
   - Graceful shutdown with cleanup
   - Status updates and TTL-based expiration

7. Inter-node Communication
   - Basic NodeCommunicator integration
   - Message handler registration system
   - Topic-based handlers for different message types

8. Heartbeat System
   - Periodic heartbeat publication to Redis (2-second intervals)
   - Failure detection with retry logic
   - Health degradation after consecutive failures
   - Timestamp-based activity tracking

9. Node Discovery
   - Active node scanning and detection
   - Last-seen time tracking for nodes
   - Dynamic connected node list updates
   - Inactive node detection with logging

10. Leader-Follower Pattern
    - Basic leader and follower role implementation
    - Leader-specific task initialization
    - Role-based behavior differentiation

11. Time Synchronization
    - Leader broadcasting system time
    - Follower time synchronization
    - Periodic time updates (10-second intervals)
    - Timestamp standardization across nodes

------------------------------------------
NEXT IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS
------------------------------------------

1. Convert single Redis instance to Redis Cluster integration
2. Vote processing API endpoints
3. Consensus protocol for vote validation
4. Leader election implementation
5. Vote storage and retrieval mechanisms

------------------------------------------
NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------------

- Current implementation uses a hub-and-spoke model with Redis as central hub
- Communication is working reliably between nodes
- Heartbeat system successfully detects node failures
- Leader broadcasts are properly received by followers
- Logging system providing good visibility into operations
- Basic fault tolerance for Redis connection issues implemented
